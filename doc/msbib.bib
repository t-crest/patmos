	However, using an FPGA as target platform for a processor different
	
	constraints influence the CPU architecture. Digital building blocks
	
	that map well in an ASIC can result in poor resource usage in an
	
	FPGA. Considering these constraints in the architecture can result

	multiprocessor issues. It attempts not to preclude multiprocessor
	implementations but provides no direct support. This paper discusses
	the issues that need to be addressed if the RTSJ is to be better
	defined for execution on a multiprocessor system. It proposes new
	dispatching and allocation models. Issues of cost enforcement, interrupts
	affinity and processor failure are covered.},

  abstract = {Hierarchical SDF models are not compositional: a composite SDF actor
	cannot be represented as an atomic SDF actor without loss of information
	that can lead to rate inconsistency or deadlock. Motivated by the
	need for incremental and modular code generation from hierarchical
	SDF models, we introduce in this paper DSSF profiles. DSSF (Deterministic
	SDF with Shared FIFOs) forms a compositional abstraction of composite
	actors that can be used for modular compilation. We provide algorithms
	for automatic synthesis of non-monolithic DSSF profiles of composite
	actors given DSSF profiles of their sub-actors. We show how different
	tradeoffs can be explored when synthesizing such profiles, in terms
	of modularity (keeping the size of the generated DSSF profile small)
	versus reusability (maintaining necessary information to preserve
	rate consistency and deadlock-absence) as well as algorithmic complexity.
	We show that our method guarantees maximal reusability and report
	on a prototype implementation.},
