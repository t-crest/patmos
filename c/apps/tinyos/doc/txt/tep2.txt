Abstract
========


This TEP documents a *Hardware Abstraction Architecture (HAA)* for
TinyOS 2.0 that balances the conflicting requirements of code
reusability and portability on the one hand and efficiency and
performance optimization on the other. Its three-layer design
gradually adapts the capabilities of the underlying hardware platforms
to the selected platform-independent hardware interface between the
operating system core and the application code. At the same time, it
allows the applications to utilize a platform's full capabilities --
exported at the second layer, when the performance requirements
outweigh the need for cross-platform compatibility.


1. Introduction
===============

The introduction of hardware abstraction in operating systems has
proved valuable for increasing portability and simplifying application
development by hiding the hardware intricacies from the rest of the
system. However, hardware abstractions come into conflict with the
performance and energy-efficiency requirements of sensor network
applications.

This drives the need for a well-defined architecture of hardware
abstractions that can strike a balance between these conflicting
goals.  The main challenge is to select appropriate levels of
abstraction and to organize them in form of TinyOS components to
support reusability while maintaining energy-efficiency through access
to the full hardware capabilities when it is needed.

This TEP proposes a three-tier *Hardware Abstraction Architecture
(HAA)* for TinyOS 2.0 that combines the strengths of the component
model with an effective organization in form of three different levels
of abstraction. The top level of abstraction fosters portability by
providing a platform-independent hardware interface, the middle layer
promotes efficiency through rich hardware-specific interfaces and the
lowest layer structures access to hardware registers and interrupts.

The rest of this TEP specifies:

* the details of the *HAA* and its three distinct layers  
  (`2. Architecture`_)
* guidelines on selecting the "right" level of abstraction 
  (`3. Combining different levels of abstraction`_)
* how hardware abstractions can be shared among different TinyOS
  platforms (`4. Horizontal decomposition`_)
* the level of hardware abstraction for the processing units 
  (`5. CPU abstraction`_)
* how some hardware abstractions may realize different degrees of
  alignment with the *HAA* top layer 
  (`6. HIL alignment`_)

The *HAA* is the architectural basis for many TinyOS 2.0 documentary
TEPs, e.g. [TEP101]_, [TEP102]_, [TEP103]_ and so forth. Those TEPs
focus on the hardware abstraction for a particular hardware module,
and [TEP112]_ and [TEP115]_ explain how power management is realized.


2. Architecture
===============

In the proposed architecture (Fig.1_), the hardware abstraction
functionality is organized in three distinct layers of components.
Each layer has clearly defined responsibilities and is dependent on
interfaces provided by lower layers.  The capabilities of the
underlying hardware are gradually adapted to the established
platform-independent interface between the operating system and the
applications. As we move from the hardware towards this top interface,
the components become less and less hardware dependent, giving the
developer more freedom in the design and the implementation of
reusable applications.

              Fig.1: The proposed Hardware Abstraction Architecture



In contrast to the more traditional two step approach used in other
embedded operating systems like [WindowsCE]_, the three-level design
results in increased *flexibility* that arises from separating the
platform-specific abstractions and the adaptation wrappers that
upgrade or downgrade them to the current platform-independent
interface.  In this way, for maximum performance, the platform
specific applications can circumvent the *HIL* components and directly
tap to the *HAL* interfaces that provide access to the full
capabilities of the hardware module.

The rest of the section discusses the specific roles of each component
layer in more detail.


Hardware Presentation Layer (HPL)
---------------------------------

The components belonging to the *HPL* are positioned directly over the
HW/SW interface. As the name suggests, their major task is to
"present" the capabilities of the hardware using the native concepts
of the operating system.  They access the hardware in the usual way,
either by memory or by port mapped I/O. In the reverse direction, the
hardware can request servicing by signaling an interrupt. Using these
communication channels internally, the *HPL* hides the hardware
intricacies and exports a more readable interface (simple function
calls) for the rest of the system.

The *HPL* components SHOULD be stateless and expose an interface that
is fully determined by the capabilities of the hardware module that is
abstracted. This tight coupling with the hardware leaves little
freedom in the design and the implementation of the components.  Even
though each *HPL* component will be as unique as the underlying
hardware, all of them will have a similar general structure. For
optimal integration with the rest of the architecture, each *HPL*
component SHOULD have:

- commands for initialization, starting, and stopping of the
  hardware module that are necessary for effective power management
  policy
- "get" and "set" commands for the register(s) that control
  the operation of the hardware
- separate commands with descriptive names for the most
  frequently used flag-setting/testing operations
- commands for enabling and disabling of the interrupts generated by
  the hardware module
- service routines for the interrupts that are generated by the
  hardware module

The interrupt service routines in the *HPL* components perform only
the most time critical operations (like copying a single value,
clearing some flags, etc.), and delegate the rest of the processing to
the higher level components that possess extended knowledge about the
state of the system.

The above *HPL* structure eases manipulation of the hardware.  Instead
of using cryptic macros and register names whose definitions are
hidden deep in the header files of compiler libraries, the programmer
can now access hardware through a familiar interface.

This *HPL* does not provide any substantial abstraction over the
hardware beyond automating frequently used command
sequences. Nonetheless, it hides the most hardware-dependent code and
opens the way for developing higher-level abstraction components.
These higher abstractions can be used with different *HPL*
hardware-modules of the same class.  For example, many of the
microcontrollers used on the existing sensornet platforms have two
USART modules for serial communication.  They have the same
functionality but are accessed using slightly different register names
and generate different interrupt vectors. The *HPL* components can
hide these small differences behind a consistent interface, making the
higher-level abstractions resource independent.  The programmer can
then switch between the different USART modules by simple rewiring
(*not* rewriting) the *HPL* components, without any changes to the
implementation code.

  
Hardware Adaptation Layer (HAL)
-------------------------------

The adaptation layer components represent the core of the
architecture. They use the raw interfaces provided by the *HPL*
components to build useful abstractions hiding the complexity
naturally associated with the use of hardware resources. In contrast
to the *HPL* components, they are allowed to maintain state that can
be used for performing arbitration and resource control.

Due to the efficiency requirements of sensor networks, abstractions at
the *HAL* level are tailored to the concrete device class and
platform. Instead of hiding the individual features of the hardware
class behind generic models, *HAL* interfaces expose specific features
and provide the "best" possible abstraction that streamlines
application development while maintaining effective use of resources.

For example, rather than using a single "file-like" abstraction for
all devices, we propose domain specific models like *Alarm*, *ADC
channel*, *EEPROM*. According to the model, *HAL* components SHOULD
provide access to these abstractions via rich, customized interfaces,
and not via standard narrow ones that hide all the functionality
behind few overloaded commands. This also enables more efficient
compile-time detection of abstraction interface usage errors.



Hardware Interface Layer (HIL)
------------------------------

The final tier in the architecture is formed by the *HIL* components
that take the platform-specific abstractions provided by the *HAL* and
convert them to hardware-independent interfaces used by cross-platform
applications.  These interfaces provide a platform independent
abstraction over the hardware that simplifies the development of the
application software by hiding the hardware differences.  To be
successful, this API "contract" SHOULD reflect the *typical* hardware
services that are required in a sensornet application.

The complexity of the *HIL* components mainly depends on how advanced
the capabilities of the abstracted hardware are with respect to the
platform-independent interface. When the capabilities of the hardware
exceed the current API contract, the *HIL* "downgrades" the
platform-specific abstractions provided by the *HAL* until they are
leveled-off with the chosen standard interface. Consequently, when the
underlying hardware is inferior, the *HIL* might have to resort to
software simulation of the missing hardware capabilities.  As newer
and more capable platforms are introduced in the system, the pressure
to break the current API contract will increase. When the performance
requirements outweigh the benefits of the stable interface, a discrete
jump will be made that realigns the API with the abstractions provided
in the newer *HAL*.  The evolution of the platform-independent
interface will force a reimplementation of the affected *HIL*
components. For newer platforms, the *HIL* will be much simpler
because the API contract and their *HAL* abstractions are tightly
related. On the other extreme, the cost of boosting up (in software)
the capabilities of the old platforms will rise.

Since we expect *HIL* interfaces to evolve as new platforms are
designed, we must determine when the overhead of software emulation of
hardware features can no longer be sustained.  At this point, we
introduce *versioning* of *HIL* interfaces.  By assigning a version
number to each iteration of an *HIL* interface, we can design
applications using a legacy interface to be compatible with previously
deployed devices.  This is important for sensor networks since they execute
long-running applications and may be deployed for years.  An *HIL* MAY
also branch, providing multiple different *HIL* interfaces with
increasing levels of functionality.


3. Combining different levels of abstraction
============================================

Providing two levels of abstraction to the application --the *HIL* and
*HAL*-- means that a hardware asset may be accessed at two levels in
parallel, e.g. from different parts of the application and the OS
libraries. 

The standard Oscilloscope application in TinyOS 2.0, for example, may
use the ADC to sample several values from a sensor, construct a
message out of them and send it over the radio. For the sake of
cross-platform compatibility, the application uses the standard
``Read`` interface provided by the ADC *HIL* and forwarded by the
``DemoSensorC`` component wired to, for example, the temperature
sensor wrapper.  When enough samples are collected in the message
buffer, the application passes the message to the networking stack.
The MAC protocol might use clear channel assessment to determine when
it is safe to send the message, which could involve taking several ADC
samples of an analog RSSI signal provided by the radio hardware. Since
this is a very time critical operation in which the correlation
between the consecutive samples has a significant influence, the
programmer of the MAC might directly use the hardware specific
interface of the *HAL* component as it provides much finer control
over the conversion process. (Fig.2_) depicts how the ADC hardware
stack on the MSP430 MCU on the level of *HIL* and *HAL* in parallel.

                       via *HIL* and *HAL* in parallel


To support this type of "vertical" flexibility the ADC *HAL* includes
more complex arbitration and resource control functionality [TEP108]_
so that a safe shared access to the *HPL* exported resources can be
guaranteed.


4. Horizontal decomposition
===========================

In addition to the *vertical* decomposition of the *HAA*, a
*horizontal* decomposition can promote reuse of the hardware resource
abstractions that are common on different platforms.  To this aim,
TinyOS 2.0 introduces the concept of *chips*, the self-contained
abstraction of a given hardware chip: microcontroller, radio-chip,
flash-chip, etc.  Each chip decomposition follows the *HAA* model,
providing *HIL* implementation(s) as the topmost component(s).
Platforms are then built as compositions of different chip components
with the help of "glue" components that perform the mapping (Fig.3_)

      timer. The micaZ platform code maps this to a specific Atmega128
      timer.


Some of the shared hardware modules are connected to the
microcontroller using one of the standard bus interfaces: SPI, I2C,
UART. To share hardware drivers across different platforms the issue
of the abstraction of the interconnect has to be solved. Clearly,
greatest portability and reuse would be achieved using a generic bus
abstraction like in NetBSD [netBSD]_. This model abstracts the
different bus protocols under one generic bus access scheme.  In this
way, it separates the abstraction of the chip from the abstraction of
the interconnect, potentially allowing the same chip abstraction to be
used with different connection protocols on different platforms.
However, this generalization comes at high costs in performance. This
may be affordable for desktop operating systems, but is highly
sub-optimal for the application specific sensor network platforms.

TinyOS 2.0 takes a less generic approach, providing *HIL*-level,
microcontroller-independent abstractions of the main bus protocols
like I2C, SPI, UART and pin-I/O. This distinction enables
protocol-specific optimizations, for example, the SPI abstraction does
not have to deal with client addresses, where the I2C abstraction
does. Furthermore, the programmer can choose to tap directly into the
chip-specific *HAL*-level component, which could further improve the
performance by allowing fine tuning using chip-specific configuration
options.

The TinyOS 2.0 bus abstractions, combined with the ones for low-level
pin-I/O and pin-interrupts (see [TEP117]_), enable a given chip
abstraction to be reused on any platform that supports the required
bus protocol.  The CC2420 radio, for example, can be used both on the
Telos and on micaZ platforms, because the abstractions of the serial
modules on the MSP430 and Atmega128 microcontrollers support the
unified SPI bus abstraction, which is used by the same CC2420 radio
stack implementation.

Sharing chips across platforms raises the issue of resource contention
on the bus when multiple chips are connected to it. For example, on
the micaZ the CC2420 is connected to a dedicated SPI bus, while on the
Telos platform one SPI bus is shared between the CC2420 radio and the
flash chip. To dissolve conflicts the resource reservation mechanism
proposed in [TEP108_] is applied: every chip abstraction that uses a
bus protocol MUST use the ``Resource`` interface in order to gain
access to the bus resource. In this way, the chip can be safely used
both in dedicated scenarios, as well as in situations where multiple
chips are connected to the same physical bus interconnect.


5. CPU abstraction
==================

In TinyOS most of the variability between the processing units is
hidden from the OS simply by using a nesC/C based programming language
with a common compiler suite (GCC). For example, the standard library
distributed with the compiler creates the necessary start-up code for
initializing the global variables, the stack pointer and the interrupt
vector table, shielding the OS from these tasks. To unify things
further, TinyOS provides common constructs for declaring reentrant and
non-reentrant interrupt service routines and critical code-sections.

The *HAA* is not currently used to abstract the features of the
different CPUs. For the currently supported MCUs, the combination of
the compiler suite support and the low-level I/O is
sufficient. Nevertheless, if new cores with radically different
architectures need to be supported by TinyOS in the future, this part
of the hardware abstraction functionality will have to be explicitly
addressed.


6. HIL alignment
================

While the *HAA* requires that the *HIL* provides full hardware
independence (`Strong/Real HILs`_), some abstractions might only
partially meet this goal (`Weak HILs`_). This section introduces
several terms describing different degrees of alignment with the
concept of a *HIL*. It also uses the following differentiation:

- *platform-defined X:* X is defined on all platforms, but the
  definition may be different

- *platform-specific X:* X is defined on just one platform


Strong/Real HILs 
----------------

*Strong/Real HILs* mean that "code using these abstractions can
reasonably be expected to behave the same on all implementations".
This matches the original definition of the *HIL* level according to
the *HAA*.  Examples include the *HIL* for the Timer (TimerMilliC,
[TEP102]_), for LEDs (LedsC), active messages (ActiveMessageC,
[TEP116]_, if not using any radio metadata at least), sensor wrappers
(DemoSensorC, [TEP109]_) or storage ([TEP103]_). Strong *HILs* may use
platform-defined types if they also provide operations to manipulate
them (i.e., they are platform-defined abstract data types), for
example, the TinyOS 2.x message buffer abstraction, ``message_t``
([TEP111]_).

Weak HILs
---------

*Weak HILs* mean that one "can write portable code over these
abstractions, but any use of them involves platform-specific
behavior". Although such platform-specific behavior can --at least at
a rudimentary syntactical level-- be performed by a
platform-independent application, the semantics require knowledge of
the particular platform.  For example, the ADC abstraction requires
platform-specific configuration and the returned data must be
interpreted in light of this configuration. The ADC configuration is
exposed on all platforms through the "AdcConfigure" interface that
takes a platform-defined type (adc_config_t) as a parameter. However,
the returned ADC data may be processed in a platform-independent way,
for example, by calculating the max/min or mean of multiple ADC
readings.

The benefit from weak *HILs* are that one can write portable utility
code, e.g., a repeated sampling for an ADC on top of the data path.
While code using these abstractions may not be fully portable, it will
still be easier to port than code built on top of *HALs*, because weak
*HILs* involve some guidelines on how to expose some functionality,
which should help programmers and provide guidance to platform
developers.


Hardware Independent Interfaces (HII)
--------------------------------------

*Hardware Independent Interfaces (HII)*, is just an interface
definition intended for use across multiple platforms.

Examples include the SID interfaces, the pin interfaces from [TEP117]_,
the Alarm/Counter/etc interfaces from [TEP102]_.


Utility components
------------------

*Utility components* are pieces of clearly portable code (typically
generic components), which aren't exposing a self-contained service.
Examples include the components in tos/lib/timer and the
ArbitratedRead* components. These provide and use HIIs.



6. Conclusion
====================================================================

The proposed hardware abstraction architecture provides a set of core
services that eliminate duplicated code and provide a coherent view of
the system across different platforms. It supports the concurrent use
of platform-independent and the platform-dependent interfaces in the
same application. In this way, applications can localize their
platform dependence to only the places where performance matters,
while using standard cross-platform hardware interfaces for the
remainder of the application.
