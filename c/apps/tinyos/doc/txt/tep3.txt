Introduction
========================================================================

The purpose of a naming convention is twofold:
  - To avoid collisions which prevent compilation or lead to errors.
    In TinyOS the most important place to avoid such collisions is in
    interface and component names.
  - To enable readers of the code to identify which names are grouped
    together and which packages they are defined in.

Remember that code that is useful will end up being read far more often
than it is written.  If you deviate from the suggestions or requirements
below, be consistent in how you do so.  If you add any new conventions to
your code, note it in a README.


General Conventions
========================================================================

General
-------

  - Avoid the use of acronyms and abbreviations that are not well known.
    Try not to abbreviate "just because".
  - Acronyms should be capitalized (as in Java), i.e., Adc, not ADC.
    Exception: 2-letter acronyms should be all caps (e.g., AM for active 
    messages, not Am)
  - If you need to abbreviate a word, do so consistently.  Try to be
    consistent with code outside your own.
  - All code should be documented using `nesdoc` [nesdoc]_, `Doxygen`
    [Doxygen]_ or `Javadoc` [Javadoc]_.  Ideally each command, event and
    function has documentation.  At a bare minimum the interface, component,
    class or file needs a paragraph of description.
  - If you write code for a file, add an `@author` tag to the toplevel
    documentation block.


Packages
========================================================================
 
For the purposes of this document a package is a collection of related
source and other files, in whatever languages are needed.  A package is
a logical grouping.  It may or may not correspond to a physical grouping
such as a single directory.  In TinyOS a package is most often a
directory with zero or more subdirectories.

nesC and C do not currently provide any package support, thus names
of types and components in different packages might accidentally 
clash. To make this less likely, judiciously use prefixes on groups
of related files (often, but not always, part of a single package). 
See the examples below.

In a package, we distinguish between public components (intended to
be used and wired outside the package) and private components (only
used and wired within the package). This distinction is not enforced
by nesC.

Directory structure
-------------------

  - Each package should have it's own directory.  It may have as many
    subdirectories as are necessary.
  - The package's directory should match the package's prefix (if it
    uses one), but in lower-case.
  - The default packages in a TinyOS distribution are:

    - `tos/system/`.  Core TinyOS components.  This directory's
       components are the ones necessary for TinyOS to actually run.
    - `tos/interfaces/`.  Core TinyOS interfaces, including
       hardware-independent abstractions.  Expected to be heavily
       used not just by `tos/system` but throughout all other code.
       `tos/interfaces` should only contain interfaces named in TEPs.
    - `tos/platforms/`.  Contains code specific to mote platforms, but
       chip-independent.
    - `tos/chips/`.  Contains code specific to particular chips and to
       chips on particular platforms.
    - `tos/lib/`.  Contains interfaces and components which extend the
       usefulness of TinyOS but which are not viewed as essential to its
       operation.  Libraries will likely contain subdirectories.
    - `apps/`, `apps/demos`, `apps/tests`, `apps/tutorials`.  Contain
       applications with some division by purpose.  Applications may
       contain subdirectories.
  - It is not necessary that packages other than the core break up their
    components and their interfaces.  The core should allow overrides of
    components fairly easily however.
  - Each directory should have a README.txt describing its purpose.


Language Conventions
========================================================================

nesC convention
---------------

Names
.....

  - All nesC files must have a `.nc` extension.  The nesC compiler requires
    that the filename match the interface or component name.
  - Directory names should be lowercase.
  - Interface and component names should be mixed case, starting upper
    case.
  - All public components should be suffixed with 'C'.
  - All private components should be suffixed with 'P'.
  - Avoid interfaces ending in 'C' or 'P'.
  - If an interface and component are related it is useful if they have
    the same name except for the suffix of the component.
  - Commands, events, tasks and functions should be mixed case, starting
    lower case.
  - Events which handle the second half of a split-phase operation begun
    in a command should have names that are related to the commands.
    Making the command past tense or appending `'Done'` are suggested.
  - Constants should be all upper case, words separated by underscores.
    - Use of `#define` for integer constants is discouraged: use `enum`.
  - Type arguments to generic components and interfaces should use the
    same case as C types: all lower-case separated by underscores, ending
    in '_t'.
  - Module (global) variables should be mixed case, starting lower case.

Packages
........

  - Each package may use a prefix for its component, interface and
    global C names. These prefixes may sometimes be common to multiple
    packages. Examples:

      - All hardware presentation layer names start with Hpl (this is
        an example of a shared prefix).
      - Chip-specific hardware abstraction layer components and interfaces
        start with the chip name, e.g., Atm128 for ATmega128.
      - The Mat√© virtual machine uses the Mate to prefix all its names.
      - Core TinyOS names (e.g., the timer components, the Init interface) 
        do not use a prefix.

  - Some packages may use multiple prefixes. For instance, the ATmega128
    chip package uses an Hpl prefix for hardware presentation layer
    components and Atm128 for hardware abstraction layer components.

Preprocessor
............

  - Don't use the nesC `includes` statement.  It does not handle macro
    inclusion properly.  Use `#include` instead.
  - Macros declared in an `.nc` file must be `#define`'d after the
    `module` or `configuration` keyword to actually limit their scope to 
    the module.
  - Macros which are meant for use in multiple `.nc` files should be
    `#define`'d in a `#include`'d C header file.
  - Use of macros should be minimized:
    `#define` should only be used where `enum` and `inline` do not suffice.

    - Arguments to `unique()` should be `#define` string constants rather
      than strings.  This minimizes nasty bugs from typos the compiler
      can't catch.


C Convention
------------
  - All C files have a .h (header) or (rarely) a .c (source) extension.

    - Filenames associated with a component should have the same name as 
      the component.
    - Filenames of a package should have a name with the package
      prefix (if any).

    - Filenames which are not associated with a component should be lowercase.

  - C does not protect names in any way. If a package uses a prefix, it
    should also use it for all types, tags, functions, variables, 
    constants and macros. This leads naturally to:

    - Minimize C code outside of nesC files.  In particular: most uses of
      hardware specific macros in TinyOS 1.x should be replaced with nesC
      components in TinyOS 2.x.

  - C type names (define with `typedef`) should be lower case, words
    separated by underscores and ending in `'_t'`.
  - C tag names (for `struct`, `union`, or `enum`) should be lower case,
    words separated by underscores.  Types with tag names should provide
    a typedef.
  - C types which represent opaque pointers (for use in parameters) should
    be named similar to other types but should end in `'_ptr_t'`.
  - Functions should be lower case, words separated by underscores.
  - Function macros (`#define` ) should be all upper case, words separated
    by underscores.

    - Using function macros is discouraged: use `inline` functions.

  - Constants should be all upper case, words separated by underscores.
    - Use of `#define` for integer constants is discouraged: use `enum`.
  - Global variables should be mixed case, starting lower case.


Java convention
---------------

  - The standard Java coding convention [Java_Coding_Convention]_
    should be followed.
  - All core TinyOS code is in the package `net.tinyos`.


Other languages
---------------

  - No established conventions.

TinyOS Conventions
========================================================================

TinyOS also follows a number of higher-level programming conventions,
mostly designed to provide a consistent "look" to TinyOS interfaces and
components, and to increase software reliability.

Error returns
-------------

TinyOS defines a standard error return type, ``error_t``, similar to Unix's
error returns, except that error codes are positive:

::

  enum {
    SUCCESS        = 0,          
    FAIL           = 1,
    ESIZE          = 2, // Parameter passed in was too big.
    ...
  };

``SUCCESS`` represents successful execution of an operation, and ``FAIL``
represents some undescribed failure. Operations can also return more
descriptive failure results using one of the Exxx constants, see the
``tos/types/TinyError.h`` file for the current list of errors.

The ``error_t`` type has a combining function to support multiple wiring
of commands or events retuning ``error_t``, defined as follows:

::

  error_t ecombine(error_t r1, error_t r2) { return r1 == r2 ? r1 : FAIL; }

This function returns ``SUCCESS`` if both error returns are ``SUCCESS``, an
error code if they both return the same error, and ``FAIL`` otherwise.

Commands that initiate a split-phase operation SHOULD return ``error_t`` if
the operation may be refused (i.e., the split-phase event may not be
signaled under some conditions). With such functions, the split-phase event
will be signaled iff the split-phase command returns ``SUCCESS``.


Passing pointers between components
-----------------------------------

Sharing data across components can easily lead to bugs such as data races,
overwriting data, etc. To minimise the likelyhood of these occurrences,
we discourage the use of pointers in TinyOS interfaces.

However, there are circumstances where pointers are necessary for
efficiency or convenience, for instance when receiving messages, reading
data from a flash chip, returning multiple results, etc.  Thus we allow the
use of pointers within interfaces as long as use of those pointers follows
an "ownership" model: at any time, only one component may refer to the
object referenced by the pointer. We distinguish two cases:

* Ownership transferred for the duration of a call: in the following command:

  ::

    command void getSomething(uint16_t *value1, uint32_t *value2);

  we are using pointers to return multiple results. The component
  implementing getSomething MAY read/write ``*value1`` or ``*value2``
  during the call and MUST NOT access these pointers after getSomething
  returns.

* Permanent ownership transfer: in the following split-phase interface:

  ::

    interface Send {
      command void send(message_t *PASS msg);
      event void sendDone(message_t *PASS msg);
    }

  components calling send or signaling ``sendDone`` relinquish ownership of
  the message buffer. For example, take a program where component A uses
  the ``Send`` interface and B provides it. If A calls ``send`` with a
  pointer to ``message_t`` *x*, then ownership of *x* passes to B and A
  MUST NOT access *x* while B MAY access *x*. Later, when B signals the
  ``sendDone`` event with a pointer to *x* as parameter, ownership of *x*
  returns to A and A MAY access *x*, while B MUST NOT access *x*.

  If an interface with ``PASS`` parameters has a return type of
  ``error_t``, then ownership is transferred iff the result is
  ``SUCCESS``. For instance, in

  ::

    interface ESend {
      command error_t esend(message_t *PASS msg);
      event void esendDone(message_t *PASS msg, error_t sendResult);
    }

  ownership is transferred only if ``esend`` returns ``SUCCESS``, while
  ownership is always transferred with ``esendDone``. This convention
  matches the rule for signaling split-phase completion events discussed
  above.

  ``PASS`` is a do-nothing macro defined as follows:

  ::

    #define PASS
  
In the future, some tool may check that programs respect these ownership
transfer rules.

Usage of wiring annotations
---------------------------

TinyOS checks constraints on a program's wiring graph specified by
annotations on a component's interfaces. Wiring constraints are specified
by placing ``@atmostonce()``, ``@atleastonce()`` and ``@exactlyonce()``
attributes on the relevant interfaces. For instance, writing

::

  module Fun {
    provides interface Init @atleastonce();
  ...

ensures that programs using module ``Fun`` must wire its ``Init`` interface
at least once.

The ``@atleastonce()`` and ``@exactlyonce()`` annotations SHOULD be used
sparingly, as they can easily prevent modularising subsystem
implementations, which is undesirable. However, the ``@atleastonce()``
annotation SHOULD be used on initialisation interfaces (typically, the
``Init`` interface) in modules, to prevent the common bug of forgetting to
wire initialisation code.
