   This document specifies a Best Current Practices for the
   TinyOS Community, and requests discussion and suggestions for
   improvements.  Distribution of this memo is unlimited.  This memo
   is in full compliance with [TEP_1]_.


1. Introduction
====================================================================

In order to document the Active Message Type [TEP_116]_, also known as
Active Message Identifier (AM ID), used by the protocols and to
prevent AM ID conflicts between applications and protocols distributed
with TinyOS 2.x, the application and protocol developers MUST use AM
IDs in the appropriate range. The network protocol implementors MUST
use AM ID allocated by the Network Protocol Working Group for the
specific protocol. The application developers MUST use AM IDs from the
unreserved pool. This TEP describes the process of AM ID allocations
and deallocations and how the allocations are documented.

2. AM ID pools
====================================================================

The unreserved pool is in the range 128-255 (0x80-0xFF). The reserved
pool is in the range 0-127 (0x00-0x7F).

2.1 Unreserved pool (0x80 - 0xFF)
---------------------------------

When an application uses the AM ID in the range 128-255, it is
guaranteed to not conflict with AM IDs used by the protocols
distributed with TinyOS 2.x. These IDs may conflict with the protocols
in the contrib tree or other applications. No allocation request is
necessary to use AM IDs in this range.

2.2 Reserved pool (0x00 - 0x7F)
-------------------------------

When a protocol uses an allocated AM ID in the reserved pool, it is
guaranteed to not conflict with AM IDs used by applications or other
protocols that also use an allocated AM ID. The AM ID may conflict
with the protocols and applications in the contrib tree.

3. Requesting AM ID Allocation
====================================================================

The Network Protocol Working Group will maintain a list of all the
allocations in the reserved range.

Developers whose protocols will be included within the ''tos''
directory MUST receive AM ID allocation from the Network Protocol
Working Group. This allocation policy applies to software and
protocols maintained by any working group.

To receive an AM ID allocation, please send an email to the chair of
Network Protocol Working Group with the following information:
* Working Group responsible for the protocol
* Name of the protocol and relevant TEPs
* Location of the protocol in TinyOS source tree
* Number of AM IDs requested and description of each ID
* Specific AM ID request (only if necessary)

Upon receiving this request, the chair of the Network Protocol Working
Group will allocate the AM ID(s) and document the allocation. If the
request is made for a specific AM ID, the chair of the Network
Protocol Work Group will try to accommodate that request.

4. Reclaiming the AM ID Allocation
====================================================================

When the working group responsible for maintaining the protocol with
an allocated AM ID obsoletes the protocol, the chair of the working
group should send a deallocation request to the chair of the Network
Protocol Working Group. The chair of the Network Protocol Working
Group will document the deallocation.

5. Documenting allocations and deallocations
====================================================================

For each TinyOS 2.x release that introduces a new protocol or use of a
new AM ID, the chair of the Network Protocol Working Group creates a
new Informational TEP that lists all the AM ID allocations for that
release. The TEP is finalized at the time of the release. [TEP_135]_
documents the AM IDs allocated for TinyOS 2.1.

Thanks to the TinyOS community at large for helping to formulate this
ID allocation policy.
