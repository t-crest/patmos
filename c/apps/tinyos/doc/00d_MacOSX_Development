Installing the TinyOS Toolchain on MacOS X.
(currently msp430 toolchain)
(last update: 2013-11-29)

currently only tested on 10.7.5 (Lion) but should also work on 10.8
and 10.9.   If you test it on these other version please let me know
and I'll update this document (cire831@gmail.com).

Uses MacPorts to install non-Apple Open Source tools.  You can use
other mechanisms but this guide references MacPorts.  MacPorts typically
requries local builds of the tools being installed.

1) You will need Xcode.  Download and install the latest version of
   Xcode for your version of the OS.  See Xcode 4.6.3 (for Lion) on:

   https://developer.apple.com/downloads/index.action

   You have to be a registered developer to get this, but signing up
   is free.  Typically you will use an existing AppleId that you have.

2) You will also want the Xcode command line tools which is a seperate
   install.   For example, for Lion, we want Xcode 4.6.3 and Command
   Line Tools (OS X Lion) for Xcode.

   There are several different versions.  You want the one that matches
   the version of Xcode that matches your OS version.

3) Install MacPorts from http://www.macports.org/install.php.

4) Install the following MacPorts ports:
   (versions as of last update)

   automake             (1.14)
   autoconf             (2.69)
   git-core             (1.8.4.3)
   git-extras           (1.9.0)
   git-flow             (0.4.1)
   msp430-binutils      (2.21.1a-20120406)
   msp430-gcc           (4.6.3-20120406)
   msp430-libc          ?
   mspdebug             (0.22)
   msp430mcu            (20120406)

5) The nesc port package is version 1.3.4 but it throws the internal
   error problem.

   Install nesc from the github repository...

   cd ~/w
   git clone https://github.com/tinyos/nesc.git
   cd nesc
   ./Bootstrap
   ./configure
   make
   sudo make install

   [If you get errors about subst-ksc not being available, be sure to
   unset your EMACSLOADPATH and try make again.]

   [Alas, the current nesc 1.3.5 (from gh:tinyos/nesc(master)) also throws
   the internal error.  A bug report has been submitted.]

6) make sure your PATH variable includes /opt/local/bin or where ever
   MacPorts is installing the ports.

7) Install the tinyos source code from the tinyos-main repository.  Follow
   the instructions at 00a_Getting_Started and 00b_Using_the_Repo (same
   directory as this file).  Say your initials are 'rh'.  Then you might
   do something like...   (see Using_the_Repo for details as to why)

   cd
   mkdir -p w/rh
   cd w/rh
   git clone https://github.com/tinyos/tinyos-main.git

        note: the above creates a locally writeable, non-repo writeable
        copy of the tinyos-main repository.  If you need to be able to
        commit back to the main repository, you need a github login and
        should follow the instructions in Using_the_Repo.

        The above remote is known as 'origin'.  The repository will be
        placed into the local directory '~/w/rh/tinyos-main'.

8) See 00d_HowTo_Environment for details on how to set up your environment
   so the toolchain knows where to find the sources.

   [This is in the process of changing so keep an eye on the tip of the
   trunk.  This file should be updated when this changes.]

   TOSROOT=~/w/rh/tinyos-main
   TOSDIR =$TOSROOT/tos
   MAKERULES=$TOSROOT/support/make/Makerules
   CLASSPATH=.:$TOSROOT/support/sdk/java/tinyos.jar
   export MAKERULES TOSDIR TOSROOT CLASSPATH

9) Install TinyOS tools.

   cd ~/w/rh/tinyos-main/tools
   ./Bootstrap
   ./configure
   make
   sudo make install    (will install into /usr/local/bin)

   [note: the port install of nesc went into /opt/local/bin.  You need both
   /usr/local/bin and /opt/local/bin in your PATH

   You may have to update tos-locate-jre (but on 10.7.5, it worked with a
   fresh clone just fine.).  Looks like 1.7.0_45.
   
   See http://olafland.wordpress.com/2012/06/25/tinyos-on-mac-os-x-10-7-lion/
   for details if you need to modify tos-locate-jre.  You may have to tweak
   jhome and xcode_jdk.

10) Install FTDI drivers (for motes that use FTDI USB chips).

11) go to apps/Blink and give it a try...   make telosb
