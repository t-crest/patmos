Tools for sniffing with Jennic platform.

The sniffing includes two components: 1. the sniffing application on the jennic
and 2. the processing app on the computer that gets the serial output of the jennic.

To compile and install the image on a jennic (on port X) run:
  -- make nxp_jn516_carrier install port,/dev/ttyUSBX

The radio channel has to be configured in TestC.nc or via compile flag.

On the computer side there are different options:

 - live view of the parsed frames with wireshark: ./run_live_ws.sh

 - one can display the raw output of the sniffer using 'python listener.py <PORT>'
    or '(python listener.py <PORT>) > <FILENAME>' to store the output to a file

 - almost the same does pcap_listener.py, but it also dumps a pcap file called sniff.pcap.

 - pcap_parser.py can transform the output format of listener.py to actual pcap file format.
    pcap_parser.py has a command line help. Call 'python pcap_parser.py --help' to see it.
    If pcap_parser.py get input and/or output files explicitly set it will use
    them, otherwise it will expects to get pipe input/output.
