"""
Tool that takes the output of Phy_Jn516Sniffer and converts it into 
pcap file format. This can be loaded into Wireshark to visualize the 
traffic on 802.15.4.
You can either define an input file using -f or let this script
read from stdin (pipe).
There is some buffering involved in the pipe approach.
This can be prevented by using python option '-u' and linux tool 'stdbuf -oL'
If you don't specifiy an output file it will output to stdout.
 
Usage:
    pcap_file_writer.py [options] [-q | -v]


Options:
    -o OUTPUT_FILE            output file to write the pcap file
    -i INPUT_FILE             file to load the sniffer output from
 
Other options:
    -h, --help                show this help message and exit
    -q, --quiet               print less text
    -v, --verbose             print more text
    --version                 show version and exit
