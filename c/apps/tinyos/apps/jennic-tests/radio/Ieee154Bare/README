Ieee154Bare

Description:

Test Ieee154Bare interface to radio. Install on two nodes, use the same TOS_NODE_ID for both.
They will each send every second a packet via the Ieee154Bare interface containing some data. The destination is the short Ieee154 adress of the node itself.
If the other node receives the packet, and all fields are identical to the ones sent out, it will flash Led0.

Expected Result:

Each node flashes its Led with 1hz.
