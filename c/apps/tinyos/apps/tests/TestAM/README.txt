Description:

TestAM sends active message broadcasts at 1Hz and briefly flickers LED 0 
whenever it has sucessfully sent a broadcast. Whenever it receives one of 
these broadcasts from another node, it toggles LED 1.  It uses the radio HIL 
component ActiveMessageC, and its packets are AM type 240.  This application 
is useful for testing AM communication and the ActiveMessageC component.

Tools:

None.

Known bugs/limitations:
