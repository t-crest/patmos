README for PhotoTemp
Author/Contact: tinyos-help@millennium.berkeley.edu

Description:

This is a hacked version of the Oscilloscope application which
simultaneously samples the PhotoC and TempC sensors of the mts300 to
ensure that arbitration is working correctly. Compile and run it like
the usual Oscilloscope application. The output normally looks like
sawteeth because it consists of alternating light and temperature
values.

Tools:

See the regular Oscilloscope tools in apps/Oscilloscope/java.

Known bugs/limitations:

None.
