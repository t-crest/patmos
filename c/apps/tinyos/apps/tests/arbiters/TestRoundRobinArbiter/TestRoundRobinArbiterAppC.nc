/**
 * Please refer to TEP 108 for more information about the components
 * this application is used to test.<br><br>
 *
 * This application is used to test the functionality of the
 * RoundRobinArbiter component developed using the Resource
 * interface.  Three Resource users are created and all three request
 * control of the resource before any one of them is granted it.
 * Once the first user is granted control of the resource, a timer
 * is set to allow this user to have control of it for a specific
 * amount of time.  Once this timer expires, the resource is released
 * and then immediately requested again.  Upon releasing the resource
 * control will be granted to the next user that has
 * requested it in Round Robin order.  Initial requests are made
 * by the three resource users in the following order<br>
 * <li> Resource 0
 * <li> Resource 2
 * <li> Resource 1
 * <br>
 * It is expected then that using a round robin policy, control of the
 * resource will be granted in the order of 0,1,2, and the Leds
 * corresponding to each resource will flash whenever this occurs.<br>
 * <li> Led 0 -> Resource 0
 * <li> Led 1 -> Resource 1
 * <li> Led 2 -> Resource 2
