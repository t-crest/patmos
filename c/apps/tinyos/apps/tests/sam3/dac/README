These test applications generate a tone on the two DAC outputs. The tone can
be observed on PB13 and PB14, or on the headset output with a
loudspeaker/headphones. Carefull, some of the tones are LOUD!

timer: This application uses a timer to trigger the samples being sent to
the DAC.

fast: This application writes as fast as it can to the DAC in a busy loop.

pdc: This application uses the PDC controller to transfer the samples from
memory to the DAC. It uses the PWM controller to generate the sampling
signal.
