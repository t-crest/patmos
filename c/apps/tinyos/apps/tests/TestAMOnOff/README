TestAMOnOff

This application has two different versions, slave and master. The
version compiled is determined by a compile-time flag (SERVICE_MASTER
or SERVICE_SLAVE). 

To compile a master:
  CFLAGS=-DSERVICE_MASTER make <platform> <other options>

To compile a slave:
  CFLAGS=-DSERVICE_SLAVE make <platform> <other options>

A master is always on. A master broadcasts a packet every second. Four of
the five packets are data packets; every fifth packet is a control packet.
It toggles Led0 when it sends a data packet and Led1 when it sends a
control packet.

When a slave hears a data packet, it toggles Led0. When a slave
hears a control packet, it turns off its radio for a short
period of time. Led1 indicates whether the slave's radio is on.

If you install a slave and a master, you should see the slave blink
Led0 a few times, then when the master blinks Led1, the slave stops
for a little while, then resumes blinking Led0.
