README for FastADC test application
Author/Contact: Antonio Linan <alinan@zolertia.com>

Description:

Thanks to the DMA implemented in the msp430, it is possible to use in 
conjunction with TimerA to perform High Speed sampling.  Data is read and
stored in flash. 

When using DMA and TimerA for ADC sampling be sure to include in makefile:
CFLAGS += -DADC12_ONLY_WITH_DMA

The data is printed over the serial port, using a client like putty or
picocom you can see the readings of the sensor adjusting the serial port
to this configuration:

bauds: 115200
bits: 8
parity: none

Tools:

None

Known bugs/limitations:

None.
