README for Phidget test application
Author/Contact: Antonio Linan <alinan@zolertia.com>

Description:

Simple test application to show how easily a Phidget sensor can be
connected to a Z1 mote, the implementation details and available
Phidgets supported (but not limited) can be found at:

/tos/platforms/z1/chips/phidgets/README

To specify the input ADC channel and the Phidget device used, check
the test application for the "enable" command.

Note: not all phidget sensors deliver results in the expected units, some
require calibration, be sure to check the README and PhidgetP.nc file for the
current sensor status.

The data is printed over the serial port, using a client like putty or
picocom you can see the readings of the sensor adjusting the serial port
to this configuration:

bauds: 115200
bits: 8
parity: none

Tools:

None

Known bugs/limitations:

None.
