README for SHT1X sensor test app
Author/Contact: Antonio Linan <alinan@zolertia.com>

Description:

This application simple polls periodically the SHT1X sensor for data
(temperature and humidity).

The data is printed over the serial port, using a client like putty or
picocom you can see the readings of the sensor adjusting the serial port
to this configuration:

bauds: 115200
bits: 8
parity: none

The SHT1X sensor is a part of the ZIGTH11 board, which can be connected 
to a Ziglet port (an I2C digital port of the Z1 mote), or to regular GPIO
port (depending on how you connect it), if using as a Ziglet make sure
IS_ZIGLET is uncommented in Makefile.

Tools:

None

Known bugs/limitations:

None.
