# Benchmark batch configuration sample file
# -----------------------------------------
#
# This file describes multiple benchmarks to be run in sequence with the LinkBenchmark
# TinyOS application along with its supporting PC-side Java application.
#
# The content of this file is YAML-formatted with a reduced key set and value sets.
# Benchmark definitions must be separated with 3 dashes ('---') in a separate line.
#
# The example below demonstrates ALL options that can be specified in the correct
# format:
# ---
# config: {bmark: 10, motes: 6, time: 1000, randstart: 30, lchance: 20}
# timers:
#  - t1: [1, 10, 100]
#  - t2: [0, 20, 200]
#  - t3: [1, 30, 300]
#  - t4: [0, 30, 300]
# forces: [ack, bcast]
# mac:
#  - lpl: [ 200 ]
#  - plink: [ 200 100 ]
# ---
#
# All values must be integers. The mandatory options are: config, config.bmark, 
# and config.time, so the most simple description is:
# config: {bmark: X, time: Y}
#
# If some options are not explicitly specified, but are required for the benchmarks,
# the default values are used. Use the command line Java code's help to get these values.
#
#
# See below some dummy examples for your pleasure!
