A CoAP application based on the TinyOS blip stack and libcoap.

Prepare libcoap:

Originally this was located in support/sdk/c/coap but has been moved to
tools/tinyos/coap.

# $ cd ../../support/sdk/c/coap
$ cd ../../tools/tinyos/c/coap
$ autoconf
$ ./configure
$ make

To build, use the 'blip' make target extra

$ make <platform> blip coap ...
