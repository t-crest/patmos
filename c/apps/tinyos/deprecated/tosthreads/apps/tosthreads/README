The applications contained in this directory are both 'example' and 'test'
applications for running TOSThreads based applications in TinyOS.  All
applications in the 'apps' directory can be compiled by running the command:

    make <platform> threads
    
and all applications in the 'capps' directory can be compiled by running:
    
    make <platform> cthreads
    
Some applications may be platform specific, but in general TOSThreads currently
supports the following platforms: tmote, telosb, iris, mica2, and micaz 

To compile all applications under 'apps' for a given platform, simpley 'cd' into
the 'apps' directory and run the 'make' command specified above.  Similarly,
'cd' into the 'capps' directory and run the 'cthreads' version of the make
command to compile all of those applications too.

There are READMEs contained in each application subdirectory that explain how
the application works, and hwo one can verify that it is operating correctly.  

I hope everyone finds these applications and their descriptions useful.  And I
hope everyone finds TOSThreads both intuitive and easy to use.  Enjoy.
