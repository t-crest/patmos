Description:

This application is used to test the threaded version of the API for accessing
the software based SineSensor usable by any platform for demonstration purposes.

You can install TestSineSensor on a mote via the following comand:
  make <platform> cthreads install
  
Valid platforms are currently: tmote, telosb, iris, shimmer*, span, mica2, micaz, and epic

This application simply takes sensor readings in an infinite loop from the
SineSensor and forwards them over the serial interface.  Upon successful
transmission, LED0 is toggled.

A successful test will result in the TestSineSensor mote constantly flickering
LED0. Additionally, messages containing the sensor readings should be forwarded
over the serial interface as verified by running the following for the platform
of interest:
  java net.tinyos.tools.Listen -comm serial@/dev/ttyUSBXXX:<baud_rate>
  
NOTE:  The baud rate 57600 must be used telos based motes, as its configuration
has been changed to work with this baud rate when compiled for tosthreads. I.e.
DO NOT just substitute 'telosb' or 'tmote' for <baud_rate> above.  Explicitly
set it to 57600.

Once this java application is running, you should see output containing the
sensor readings being streamed to your terminal.

Tools:
  None.

Known bugs/limitations:
