Description:

This application stresses the operation of the thread based AM commands for
packet transmission and reception.  To run this application you will need to
burn it on one mote with NODE_ID 0, and a second mote with NODE_ID 1.  

You can install RadioStress on a mote via the following command:
  make <platform> cthreads install.0
  make <platform> cthreads install.1
  
Valid platforms are currently: tmote, telosb, iris, shimmer*, span, mica2, micaz, and epic

The application burned with NODE_ID 0 will be programmed as a Receiver and will
wait for messages from the sender programmed with NODE_ID 1.  In the case of the
sender, messages with three different AM ids are sent from three different
threads in an infinite loop, and one of LED0, LED1, and LED2 are toggled upon
successful transmission.  In the case of the receiver, three different threads
are used to wait for messages in an infinite loop from the three sending threads
on the sender mote.  Upon successful reception, one of LED0, LED1, or LED2 is
toggled depending on the AM id received.

Successful running of this application will result in all three leds flashing
very rapidly on both motes, with the receiver mote flashing less rapidly if the
sender mote is turned off (i.e. once every 5000ms because there is a timeout on
how long it waits for messages to be received before retrying).
