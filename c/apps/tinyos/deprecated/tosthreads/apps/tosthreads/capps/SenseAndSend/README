Description:

SenseAndSend is a threaded implementation of an application that takes various
sensor readings in parallel (by dedicating one thread to each reading), and
assembling them into a packet to be sent out over the radio.  It is written
specifically for use with the tmote onboard sensor package, and will not compile
for any other platforms.

To run this application install it on a mote via the command:
  make <platform> cthreads install
  
Valid platforms are currently: tmote, telosb with onboard sensors

Readings are taken from each of the 4 oboard sensors and sent out over the radio
interface in an infinite loop.  Upon successful transmission, LED0 is toggled,
and the process starts over again.

A successful test will result in LED0 toggling periodically at a rate of
approximately 220ms (the time it takes to take a humidity + temperature sensor
reading since they share the same hardware and cannot be taken in parallel). 

Additionally, a base station application should be run to verify the reception
of packets sent from a SenseAndSend mote, with reasonable looking sensor data.

Tools:
  None.

Known bugs/limitations:
  None.
