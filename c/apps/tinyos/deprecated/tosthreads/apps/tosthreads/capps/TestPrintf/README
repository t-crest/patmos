README for TOSThreads TestPrintf 
Author/Contact: tinyos-help@millennium.berkeley.edu
Author: Kevin Klues <klueska@cs.stanford.edu>

Description:

This application tests the operation of the Printf client in TOSThreads.  It
continuously prints the value of a counter starting at 0, increasing as it
prints.

You can install TestPrintf on a mote via the following command:
  make <platform> cthreads install
  
Valid platforms are currently: tmote, telosb, iris, shimmer*, span, mica2, micaz, and epic

Once burned on a mote, the java based PrintfClient must be ran to verify
proper operation of the application.
  java net.tinyos.tools.PrintfClient -comm serial@/dev/ttyUSBXXX:<baud_rate>
  
NOTE:  The baud rate 57600 must be used telos based motes, as its configuration
has been changed to work with this baud rate when compiled for tosthreads. I.e.
DO NOT just substitute 'telosb' or 'tmote' for <baud_rate> above.  Explicitly
set it to 57600.

Once this java application is running, you should see output of the sort
continuously being streamed to your terminal:
