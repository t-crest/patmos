Description:

This application is used to test the threaded version of the API for accessing
sensors on the basicsb sensor board.

You can install TestBasicsbSensors on a mote via the following command:
  make <platform> threads install

Valid platforms are currently: mica2, micaz and iris

This application simply takes sensor readings in an infinite loop from the
Photo and Temperature sensors on the basicsb sensor board and forwards them
over the serial interface.  Upon successful transmission, LED0 is toggled.

A successful test will result in the TestBasicsbSensors mote constantly
flickering LED0. Additionally, messages containing the sensor readings should
be forwarded over the serial interface as verified by running the following
for the platform of interest:
  java net.tinyos.tools.Listen -comm serial@/dev/ttyUSBXXX:<baud_rate>

Once this java application is running, you should see output containing the
sensor readings being streamed to your terminal.

Tools:
  None.

Known bugs/limitations:
  None.
