README for SerialLoader
Author/Contact: Chieh-Jan Mike Liang <cliang4@cs.jhu.edu>

Description:

SerialLoader receives loadable programs from the serial port and stores
it in a byte array. Then, when it receives the command to load the code,
it makes the call to the dynamic loader.

Here are the steps:
1.) Load SerialLoader:
    make telosb install bsl,<device_port>
    
2.) Create the loadable code, main.tos:
	cd ../../capps/Blink
	make telosb dynthreads
	(the output file needed is ../../capps/Blink/build/telosb/dynthreads/main.tos)	

3.) Clear the byte array in the mote RAM buffer:
    ./serialloader.py <device_port> 0

4.) Upload the binary:
    ./serialloader.py <device_port> 1 main.tos
    
5.) Run the binary:
    ./serialloader.py <device_port> 7

Tools:
  None.

Known bugs/limitations:
