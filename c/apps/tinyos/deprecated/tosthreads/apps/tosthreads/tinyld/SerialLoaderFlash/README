README for SerialLoaderFlash
Author/Contact: Chieh-Jan Mike Liang <cliang4@cs.jhu.edu>

Description:

SerialLoaderFlash is similar to SerialLoader in that it receives
loadable programs from the serial port. However, SerialLoaderFlash
stores them on the external flash. Then, when it receives the command to
load the code, it makes the call to the dynamic loader.

Here are the steps:
1.) Load SerialLoader:
    make telosb install bsl,<device_port>
    
2.) Create the loadable code, main.tos:
	cd ../../capps/Blink
	make telosb dynthreads
	(the output file needed is ../../capps/Blink/build/telosb/dynthreads/main.tos)	

3.) Erase the external flash:
    ./serialloader.py <device_port> 0

4.) Upload the binary:
    ./serialloader.py <device_port> 1 main.tos
    
5.) Run the binary:
    ./serialloader.py <device_port> 7

Tools:
  None.

Known bugs/limitations:
  None.
