Description: Binary utilities supporting Atmel's AVR targets (TinyOS version)
  The programs in this package are used to manipulate binary
  and object files that may have been created for Atmel's AVR architecture.
  This package is primarily for AVR developers and cross-compilers
  and is not needed by normal users or developers.
  This version is patched and tested with TinyOS.
