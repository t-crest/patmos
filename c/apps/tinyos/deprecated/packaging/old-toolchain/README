Readme for package builder makefiles

DESCRIPTION:
===========
These Makefiles download, patch, compile the tinyos toolchain programs,
and create rpm and deb packages, if dpkg-dev and rpmbuild is available.
You can simply type "make" to start the building process.

MAKEFILE BUILD STEPS:
====================
1. set up variables
2. copy Generic.mk to the current directory
3. download the source
4. uncompress the source
5. apply patches (optional)
6. run "./configure"
7. run "make"
8. run "make DESTDIR=installdir install"
9. edit rpm spec and dpkg control file (set up name, version, etc)
10. create rpm and deb packages from installdir

The last 2 steps will be executed only if rpmbuild and/or dpkg-deb is available

CREATING NEW MAKEFILES:
======================
You have to include the following part in your Makefile:

include Generic.mk

Generic.mk:
  cp ../Generic.mk .

Of course you should use the valid path of Generic.mk

Before this include, you must set up the following variables:

SRCNAME: the name of the package (eg. binutils)
VERSION: version of the package (eg 2.17)
ARCHIVE_FORMAT: archive format of the package (eg tar.bz2. supported: tar.bz2, tar.gz, tar.xz, tar.Z)
The downladed file should have the name $(SRCNAME)-$(VERSION).$(ARCHIVE_FORMAT), otherwise you should set the following variable
SRC_ARCHIVE: the name of the downloaded archive without extension (default: $(SRCNAME)-$(VERSION))
the uncompressed source should be in the subdirectory $(SRCNAME)-$(VERSION), otherwise you should set the following variable
SRC_DIRECTORY: the subdirectory of the uncompressed code (default: $(SRCNAME)-$(VERSION))
DOWNLOAD_URL: the package will be downloaded from this url

After the include, you must add the following targets:

-check_spec_requirements: If there are additional requirements for the package building you should add commands which returns 0,
  if they're available and not 0 if not.

-cleanup: In this target, you can delete files from the compiled package to resolve file conflicts between packages 
  (eg. man for gcc shouldn't be in package avr-gcc)
  
You can configure the build procedure with the following variables:
PATCHDIR: the directory, where the patches are (all the patches (*.patch) from this directory will be applied with patch -p0; default: patch;
	if there's no patch in the patch directory, or there's no patch directory, then the patching stage will be skipped)
PATCHSTRIP: the strip number (the number after -p) for the patches (default: 0)
BOOTSTRAP_CMD: bootstrap command to run before configure (will be started from "$(SRCNAME)-$(VERSION)" directory with "./" prefix; default: no bootstraping)
CONFIGURE_OPTS: options for ./configure
CONFIG_LINE: the command for configuring before make (default: ./configure $(CONFIGURE_OPTS))
BUILD_SUBDIR: some prgrams doesn't support to compile in the source directory (like gcc). With this variable, 
  you can create a subdirectory from where the ../configure/make/make install will be started (default: no subdirectory)
INSTALL_OPTS: options for make install 
HOST: the host cpu architecture to compile. (default: build machine architecture) You have to setup a cross-compile gcc before change this.
PKG_NAME: the name of the deb/rpm package to create (default: $(SRCNAME))
PKG_VERSION: the version of the deb/rpm package to create (default: $(VERSION))
PKG_RELEASE: the release/minor version of the deb/rpm package to create (default: current date in "+%Y%m%d" format)
PKG_HOST: the cpu architecture of the deb/rpm package to create (default: $(HOST))
RPMBUILD: full path of the command 'rpmbuild' (default: search with whereis)
DPKG: full path of the command 'dpkg-deb' (default: search with whereis)

For deb package creation you will need a dpkg control file, called debcontrol. You can use the following variables here:
PKG_VERSION=$(PKG_VERSION)_$(PKG_RELEASE)
PKG_ARCHITECTURE=$(PKG_HOST)

For rpm package creation you will need an rpm spec file, called rpm.spec. You can use the following variables here:
PKG_VERSION=$(PKG_VERSION)
PKG_RELEASE=$(PKG_RELEASE)
You should only use %files and %description targets
