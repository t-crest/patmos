TinyOS Tools
============

This directory contains the TinyOS tools that are distributed in the
tinyos-tools package. These are supporting applications for building and
running TinyOS applications. In order to use TinyOS you must have a copy
of tinyos-tools installed.

To install the tinyos tools from git, rather than a package, you must first
prepare the configure scripts here:

    ./Bootstrap

Then you can configure, make and install as usual:

    ./configure
    make
    make install
