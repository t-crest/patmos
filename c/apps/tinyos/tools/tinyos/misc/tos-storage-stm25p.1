tos-storage-stm25p - Generate storage volume description code
.SH SYNOPSIS

\fBtos-storage-stm25p\fR [\fB--tosdir\fR <location of tos directory>] \fIplatform-directory\fR
.SH DESCRIPTION

\fBtos-storage-stm25p\fR reads a user specification describing the layout
of storage volumes on an ST M25P80 flash chip, and generates code
describing that layout for use by the TinyOS 2.0 storage subsystem.  The
user specification is in XML and is read from standard input. With all options,
the code for a header file is written to standard output.  With the
optional \fB-t\fR flag specified, a VolumeMapC.nc file is generated that provides
interfaces to all the storage volume abstractions defined in the XML file.

The mandatory \fIplatform-directory\fR argument should specify the platform
directory for the current compilation target; this is necessary for the correct
handling of file include statements in the XML input.

This program is normally invoked automatically by the TinyOS build system
when your application directory contains a \fBvolumes-stm25p.xml\fR file.
