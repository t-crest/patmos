Compilation order:
1. Compile & install binutils
2. Compile & install gcc
3. Compile & install avr-libc 
4. Compile & install gcc

The configure script for gcc and avr-libc checks the supported platforms for the
installed binutils and gcc respectively, so if you don't install what you compiled,
it probably wouldn't know all platforms. Recompiling gcc at the end seems stupid,
but gcc compiles something in from libc, so in theory, it must be compiled twice.
Search for the configure option "--with-avrlibc" for more.
