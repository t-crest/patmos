For full tests, do:

1) Test builds of all variants for different alarm counts:

  sh buildset.sh

   This verifies the builds, shows that only a limited number of alarms are
   available when usemux is off, and displays the size in ROM and RAM for
   each configuration to help assess the cost of using different types of
   timers/alarms.

2) Test multiple millisecond timers:

  make tmote usemux,1 install

   Led N should toggle at 8/(2^N) times per second

3) Test multiple whole-second timers

  make surf osian usemux,1 useprec,Second install

   Led N should toggle at 2^N second intervals
