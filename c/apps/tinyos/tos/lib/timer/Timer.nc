/**
 * A Timer is TinyOS's general purpose timing interface. For more precise
 * timing, you may wish to use a (platform-specific) component offering
 * an Alarm interface.
 *
 * <p>A Timer is parameterised by its "precision" (milliseconds,
 * microseconds, etc), identified by a type. This prevents, e.g.,
 * unintentionally mixing components expecting milliseconds with those
 * expecting microseconds as those interfaces have a different type.
 *
 * <p>See TEP102 for more details.

 * @param precision_tag A type indicating the precision of this Alarm.
