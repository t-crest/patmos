Deluge T2 for TinyNode
----------------------------------


These files are needed by Deluge T2 to compile for the TinyNode platform. 

Note: 

Reprogramming fails if the voltage of the node is not above a given 
threshold. Currently, this is set to 2.7V, which may be too high if 
you run your mote on batteries. In this case, set the value of
VTHRESH in the hardware.h file to a different value. 

In case you wish not to test the voltage at all, modify VoltageC.nc
s.t. the command Voltage.okToProgram() returns always TRUE.
