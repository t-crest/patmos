README for tinyos-2.x/tos/lib/tossim

This directory contains the core code for the TOSSIM TinyOS simulator.
One characteristic of TOSSIM is that it can controlled through a
Python script. Building simple yet efficient support for this requires 
presenting most TOSSIM abstractions in a C++ interface, which is then
transformed into a Python interface with the SWIG tool.

This leads most TOSSIM abstractions to have three levels: C, nesC, 
and C++. Because nesC cannot call C++ and vice versa, TOSSIM exports
its important call points as C functions. It links simple C++ wrapper
classes against the simulation binary. Python can then call through
the C++ interface.

The files tossim.h and tossim.c, for example, are the basic TOSSIM
C++ classes of Mote, Tossim, and Variable. These call functions 
in sim_tossim.c, which other parts of TOSSIM also call.

The examples/ directory contains some sample Python scripts.
