/** 
 *  The CollectionDebug is an interface for sending debugging events to
 *  a logging infrastructure. An implementer can choose to send the event
 *  information to different destinations. Primary examples can include:
 *  <ul>
 *    <li> logging to the UART, in case of a testbed of network-connected
 *         nodes;
 *    <li> logging to flash, if the logs are to be retrieved later
 *    <li> logging to the standard output, in the case of TOSSIM.
 *  </ul>
 *  
 *  The interface does not specify in what format the log is to be produced,
 *  or if other information, like timestamps, should be added, and this is
 *  up to the implementer.
 * 
 *  Some commands are generic, like Event, EventSimple, and EventDbg, while others
 *  are for more specific events related to collection, like EventRoute and EventMsg.
