/** 
 *  The TreeRoutingEngine is responsible for computing the routes for
 *  collection.  It builds a set of trees rooted at specific nodes (roots) and
 *  maintains these trees using information provided by the link estimator on
 *  the quality of one hop links.
 * 
 *  <p>Each node is part of only one tree at any given time, but there is no
 *  difference from the node's point of view of which tree it is part. In other
 *  words, a message is sent towards <i>a</i> root, but which one is not
 *  specified. It is assumed that the roots will work together to have all data
 *  aggregated later if need be.  The tree routing engine's responsibility is
 *  for each node to find the path with the least number of transmissions to
 *  any one root.
 *
 *  <p>The tree is proactively maintained by periodic beacons sent by each
 *  node. These beacons are jittered in time to prevent synchronizations in the
 *  network. All nodes maintain the same <i>average</i> beacon sending rate
 *  (defined by BEACON_INTERVAL +- 50%). The beacon contains the node's parent,
 *  the current hopcount, and the cumulative path quality metric. The metric is
 *  defined as the parent's metric plus the bidirectional quality of the link
 *  between the current node and its parent.  The metric represents the
 *  expected number of transmissions along the path to the root, and is 0 by
 *  definition at the root.
 * 
 *  <p>Every time a node receives an update from a neighbor it records the
 *  information if the node is part of the neighbor table. The neighbor table
 *  keeps the best candidates for being parents i.e., the nodes with the best
 *  path metric. The neighbor table does not store the full path metric,
 *  though. It stores the parent's path metric, and the link quality to the
 *  parent is only added when the information is needed: (i) when choosing a
 *  parent and (ii) when choosing a route. The nodes in the neighbor table are
 *  a subset of the nodes in the link estimator table, as a node is not
 *  admitted in the neighbor table with an estimate of infinity.
 * 
 *  <p>There are two uses for the neighbor table, as mentioned above. The first
 *  one is to select a parent. The parent is just the neighbor with the best
 *  path metric. It serves to define the node's own path metric and hopcount,
 *  and the set of child-parent links is what defines the tree. In a sense the
 *  tree is defined to form a coherent propagation substrate for the path
 *  metrics. The parent is (re)-selected periodically, immediately before a
 *  node sends its own beacon, in the updateRouteTask.
 *  
 *  <p>The second use is to actually choose a next hop towards any root at
 *  message forwarding time.  This need not be the current parent, even though
 *  it is currently implemented as such.
 *
 *  <p>The operation of the routing engine has two main tasks and one main
 *  event: updateRouteTask is called periodically and chooses a new parent;
 *  sendBeaconTask broadcasts the current route information to the neighbors.
 *  The main event is the receiving of a neighbor's beacon, which updates the
 *  neighbor table.
 *  
 *  <p> The interface with the ForwardingEngine occurs through the nextHop()
 *  call.
 * 
 *  <p> Any node can become a root, and routed messages from a subset of the
 *  network will be routed towards it. The RootControl interface allows
 *  setting, unsetting, and querying the root state of a node. By convention,
 *  when a node is root its hopcount and metric are 0, and the parent is
 *  itself. A root always has a valid route, to itself.
