/**
 * Implementation of the InternalFlash interface for the
 * M16c/62p mcu to be used as the TOSBoot arguments storage.
 * 
 * The implementation uses 2 flash blocks to store the arguments into. First one
 * block is filled up or written to until a error occurs. After that the second block
 * will be written to. Everytime the start address of one block is written to the
 * otherone will be erased. If a erase is not executed due to powerdown or some other
 * error a erase command will be executed on that block the next time.
 * 
 * A argument writing is surrounded by two 0x1 bytes:
 * 0x1 [arguments data] 0x1. The first byte indicating a new TOSBoot argument entry
 * and the last one indicating a successfull write of a TOSBoot argument to the flash.
