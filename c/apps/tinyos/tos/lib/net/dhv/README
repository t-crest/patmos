Title: Dhv
Author: Thanh Dang, Seungweon Park
------------------

DHV is a code consistency maintenance protocol to ensure that every node
in a network will eventually have the same code. DHV is based on the
simple observation that if two code versions are different, their
corresponding version numbers often differ in only a few least significant
bits of their binary representation. DHV allows nodes to carefully select
and transmit only necessary bit level information to detect a newer code version
in the network. Detail of the protocol can be found here

Usage:
------

To use include the following in your Makefile:

CFLAGS += -I$(TINYOS_OS_DIR)/lib/net
CFLAGS += -I$(TINYOS_OS_DIR)/lib/net/dhv
CFLAGS += -I$(TINYOS_OS_DIR)/lib/net/dhv/interfaces

* add a following line when use BaseStation
CFLAGS += -DTOSH_DATA_LENGTH=32
