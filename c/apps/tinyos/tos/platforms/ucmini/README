The ucmini platform has the following configuration options:
DISABLE_SERIAL_AUTO
You can disable the automatic serial control by defining this
DISABLE_SERIAL_RESET
You can disable the automatic serial reset by defining this
SERIAL_AUTO_VDD
You can change the automatic serial control detection mode by defining this: If you define this, the serial control
checks the usb power, otherwise it checks the usb suspend signal (if you define this, the serial stack turns on if
you plug your mote to a usb charger)
UCMINI_REV
The ucmini revison you use, multiplied by 100. Known revisions (default is the highest):
49: testboard
52: new ldo, accelerometer, leds moved, usb detection and Vbatt measurment changed
53: accelerometer connection changed
100: usb detection changed, pull-up resistors on i2c bus
101: switchable power for flash chip, user button. Connected USB might jams radio communication
110,120: test versions for 200
200: new usb bridge (ft230x), measurable battery voltage, detectable battery switch, reset over usb gpio, inverted leds, fixed usb-radio jamming
