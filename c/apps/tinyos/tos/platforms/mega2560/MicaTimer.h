#ifndef MICATIMER_H

/* This file defines the rates at which the mica family's atmega128 timer 1
   and 3 timers run at. The goal is to present the user with microsend and
   32khz timers, but it may not be possible to run the timers at these rates
   (because of the limited prescaler selection).

   So TinyOS picks a prescaler (based on the selected processor MHz) for
   each of these timers, and builds corresponding 16-bit alarms&counters
   (AlarmOne16C, AlarmThree16C, CounterOne16C, CounterThree16C) over
   hardware timers 1 and 3. TinyOS then divides these hardware timers by
   the appropriate power of 2 to get approximate 32-bit 32kHz and 1MHz
   alarms and counters (Alarm32khz32C, AlarmMicro32C, Counter32khz32C,
   CounterMicro32C).

   The constants and typedefs for all this configuration are defined here,
   based on the value of the MHZ preprocessor symbol, which shoud approximate
   the platform's MHZ rate.

   Note that the timers thus obtained will not be exactly at 32768Hz or
   1MHz, because the clock doesn't divide by a power of two to those
   frequencies, and/or the clock frequency is not accurate. If you need
   more accurate timing, you should use the calibration functions
   offered by the Atm128Calibrate interface provided by PlatformC.

   This file also defines EXT_STANDBY_T0_THRESHOLD, a threshold on
   remaining time till the next timer 0 interrupt under which the mote
   should sleep in ext standby rather than power save. This is only
   important when not using the internal oscillator.  Wake up from power
   save takes 65536 cycles (6 cycles for ext standby), which is, e.g.,
   ~9.4ms at 7Mhz.
