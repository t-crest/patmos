In AM_LDO_VCORE0, Active Mode, LDO power, VCore0, the cpu max frequency is
24MHz.  But all the dividers for the timers and other subsystems are all
power of 2.  So we set the main DCOCLK to 16MiHz.  The flash on the other
hand needs 1 wait state above 16MHz when Vcore0.  So we use Vcore1.

The clocks on the msp432 for the exp_msp432 eval board are set up as follows:

 * DCOSEL_3:    center 12MHz (~8 < 12 < 16, but is actually larger)
 * DCORES:      external resistor
 * DCOTUNE:     +152 (0x98), moves us up to 16MiHz.
 * ACLK:        LFXTCLK/1       32768
 * BCLK:        LFXTCLK/1       32768
 * SMCLK:       DCO/2           8MiHz
 * HSMCLK:      DCO/1           16MiHz
 * MCLK:        DCO/1           16MiHz

 * CLK_DCOTUNE was determined by running CS_setDCOFrequency(TARGET_FREQ)
 * and seeing what it produced.

 * Timers:
 *
 * RTCCLK <- BCLK/1 (32Ki)
 * TMicro <-  TA0 <- SMCLK/8 <- DCO/2 (1MiHz)
 * TMilli <-  TA1 <- ACLK/1 (32KiHz)
 * rawUsecs<- T32_1 <- MCLK/16 <- DCO/1 32 bit raw usecs
 * rawJiffies<- TA0 <- ACLK/1 (32KiHz) 16 bits wide

 * LFXTCLK -> ACLK, BCLK
 * HFXTCLK off
 * MCLK (Main Clock) - 16MiHz, <- DCOCLK/1
 * HSMCLK (high speed submain) <- DCOCLK/1 16MiHz (can be faster than 12 MHz)
 *     only can drive ADC14.
 * SMCLK (low speed submain)   DCOCLK/2, 8MiHz (dont exceed 12MHz)
 * SMCLK/8 -> TA0 (1us) -> TMicro
 * ACLK/1 (32KiHz) -> TA1 (1/32768) -> TMilli
 * BCLK/1 (32KiHz) -> RTC


There are clock calibration values in the TLV.  These values are factory
set to appropriate values.  These values where used in the calculation
to determine the register settings for the DCO clock.  The cells used are:

DCOIR_FCAL_RSEL04,   DCOIR_FCAL_RSEL5,  DCOIR_CONSTK_RSEL04, 
DCOIR_CONSTK_RSEL5,  DCOER_FCAL_RSEL04, DCOER_FCAL_RSEL5,
DCOER_CONSTK_RSEL04, DCOER_CONSTK_RSEL5

After clock system initialzation:

CTL0 = 0x430098,
CTL1 = 0x10000033,
CTL2 = 0x10103,
CTL3 = 0xbb,
CLKEN = 0xf,
STAT = 0x1f0f0043,
DCOERCAL0 = 0x1b70001,
DCOERCAL1 = 0x1b8
