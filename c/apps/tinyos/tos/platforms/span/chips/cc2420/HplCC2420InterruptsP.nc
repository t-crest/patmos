 * this implements an interrupt-driven capture interface for the cc2420
 * tx-mode use of sfd.  span does not have sfd routed to a timer capture pin
 * on the msp430, so cc2420's capture mechanism fails.  
 * this module will trigger a capture.captured event after receiving the
 * appropriate interrupt from the span sfd pin (2.7)
