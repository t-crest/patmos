This directory contains tinyos 2.x platform support for the Intel
SHIMMER mote.  Please use the mailing list given below to post
questions and comments.


Usage
-----
You can compile and install applications for the SHIMMER platform just
like with any standard platform, "make shimmer install ..." (Note:
you must have a shimmer programming board).

For example, to complie and install Blink, do the following:

  $ cd $TINYOS_ROOT_DIR/apps/Blink
  $ make shimmer install bsl,X

where X is your serial port.

You may also want to test the radio.  Do this by compiling and
installing "$TINYOS_ROOT_DIR/apps/RadioCountToLeds" on TWO shimmers (for
sending and receiving radio messages).
