README for Phidget test application
Author/Contact: Antonio Linan <alinan@zolertia.com>

This README sumarizes the implementation of a basic driver to allow
Phidget-like sensors to be used with the Z1 motes

The following phidgets are implemented:

* Phidget 1109. Rotation sensor
http://www.phidgets.com/products.php?product_id=1109
Basic rotation sensor, ranging from 0-1000
Normally powered at 3VDC

* Phidget 1129. Touch sensor
http://www.phidgets.com/products.php?product_id=1129
Basic touch sensor, outputs either HIGH/LOW, represented by Vin/0V
Normally powered at 3VDC

* Phidget 1120: Flexiforce force sensor
http://www.phidgets.com/documentation/Phidgets/3100_0_FlexiforceUserManual.pdf
Please note that the ranges depend mostly on the FlexiForce model used.
This sensor should be powered at 5VDC, it is recommended to use ADC0/ADC3 as
explained below.
Information on how to calibrate the sensor is available at:
http://www.phidgets.com/documentation/Phidgets/3100_0_FlexiforceUserManual.pdf

* Phidget 1108. Magnetic sensor
http://www.phidgets.com/products.php?product_id=1108
Magnetic hall-effect sensor, output is proportional to the the applied magnetic field
This sensor should be powered at 5VDC, it is recommended to use ADC0/ADC3 as
explained below.
The values are given in Gauss according to Phidget user manual

* Phidget 3522/3520. Sharp distance sensor
http://www.phidgets.com/products.php?product_id=3522 / 3520
3522: 20-150 cms
3520: 54-30 cms
Distance sensor,his popular sensor made by Sharp produces an analog output that varies
depending on the distance (see reference page)
This sensor should be powered at 5VDC, it is recommended to use ADC0/ADC3 as
explained below.
Note: this sensor does not have a standard 2.54mm pitch, the connector is not
the standard phidget, the phidget 1101 adapter is recomended

* Phidget 1135: Precision voltage sensor (up to 30VDC)
http://www.phidgets.com/products.php?product_id=1135
This sensor should be powered at 5VDC, it is recommended to use ADC0/ADC3 as
explained below.
Results are given in mV.

* Phidget 1122: Current sensor AC/DC up to 30A:
http://www.phidgets.com/products.php?product_id=1122
This sensor should be powered at 5VDC, it is recommended to use ADC0/ADC3 as
explained below.
Results are given in mA.

* Phidget 1130: pH/ORP Adapter
http://www.phidgets.com/products.php?product_id=1130
Tested with ph Lab Electrode ASP2000 from:
http://www.phidgets.com/products.php?product_id=3550
This sensor should be powered at 5VDC, it is recommended to use ADC0/ADC3 as
explained below.


Connection:

The North port of the Z1 mote exposes the ADC input channels, as well as 
3.3V/5VDC and GND pins, allowing to directly use 3.3/5VDC-powered phidgets
connected to a standard 3-pin phidget connector.  Zolertia (upon client
request) normally dispatch the Z1 motes with the following 3-pin connectors:

Top row
             ____________   ____________
             |          |   |          |
             --|--|--|---   --|--|--|---
              GND 3V ADC7    GND 3V ADC1

Bottom row
             ____________   ____________
             |          |   |          |
             --|--|--|---   --|--|--|---
              GND 5V ADC3    GND 5V ADC0

ADC input ADC3 and ADC0 has resistor divider to allow 5V inputs, 5:3.

The available ADC input channels are noted by the following constants:

   // see device specific data sheet which pin Ax is mapped to
   INPUT_CHANNEL_A0 = 0,                    // input channel A0 
   INPUT_CHANNEL_A1 = 1,                    // input channel A1
   INPUT_CHANNEL_A2 = 2,                    // input channel A2
   INPUT_CHANNEL_A3 = 3,                    // input channel A3
   INPUT_CHANNEL_A4 = 4,                    // input channel A4
   INPUT_CHANNEL_A5 = 5,                    // input channel A5
   INPUT_CHANNEL_A6 = 6,                    // input channel A6
   INPUT_CHANNEL_A7 = 7,                    // input channel A7

The driver does not check if a 5VDC phidget is connected to one of both available
5V Phidget ports, it is recommended that these input channels are used.
