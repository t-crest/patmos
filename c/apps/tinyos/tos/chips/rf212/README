The RF212 radio driver has the following configuration options. Some of
these are set in the platforms/xxx/chips/rf212/RadioConfig.h header file,
see the meshbean900 platform for example, others can be set in your Makefile.

RF212_TRX_CTRL_0_VALUE:

This is the value of the TRX_CTRL_0 register which configures the output
pin currents and the CLKM clock:

RF212_CCA_MODE_VALUE:

This is the default value of the CCA_MODE field in the PHY_CC_CCA register
which is used to configure the default mode of the clear channel assesment

RF212_CCA_THRES_VALUE:

This is the value of the CCA_THRES register that controls the energy levels
used for clear channel assesment.

RF212_DEF_RFPOWER:

This is the default value of the TX_PWR field of the PHY_TX_PWR register.
This can be cahanged via the PacketTransmitPower interface provided by the
RF212ActiveMessageC.

RF212_DEF_CHANNEL:

This is the default value of the CHANNEL field of the PHY_CC_CCA register.
This can be cahanged via the RadioChannel interface provided by the
RF212ActiveMessageC.

RF212_RSSI_ENERGY:

If you define this, then the content of the RF212_PHY_ED_LEVEL is queried
instead of the RSSI value for eahc incoming message. This value can be
obtained with the PacketRSSI interface.

RF212_SLOW_SPI:

Define this if your microcontroller SPI interface is slower than your radio.
This delays the start of transmission untill the whole packet is uploaded
except for the last few bytes for time sync messages.
