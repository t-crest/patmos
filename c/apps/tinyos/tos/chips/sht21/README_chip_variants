SHT20/SHT25: 
These chips are less (SHT20) or more (SHT25) accurate then SHT21, but on the software side, they're completly identical,
so the driver is usable for them as well.

STS21:
This is basicly the same as the SHT21, but it has no humidity sensor, and it has a different i2c address. To use the
driver for STS21, define the const STS21_MODE.
