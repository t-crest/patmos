  - Sync between RTC

o Capture

o RTC

  - RTC calibration

o Flash

  - power of flash in sleep


o MCUSleep

o what is the Wake on Interrupt Controller?

o Verify clocks on exp-msp432p401r
  - 32KiHz - ACLK
  - 16MHz  - DCOCLK
  - RTCCLK - RTC Calibration

o ADC - clock rate?
  - clocked by HSMCLK, eh?
  - table 5-27, upto 25MHz
