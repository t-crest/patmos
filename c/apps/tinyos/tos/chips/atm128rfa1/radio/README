The RFA1 radio driver has the following configuration options. Some of
these are set in the platforms/xxx/RadioConfig.h header file,
see the UCMini platform for example, others can be set in your Makefile.

RFA1_CCA_MODE_VALUE:

This is the default value of the CCA_MODE field in the PHY_CC_CCA register
which is used to configure the default mode of the clear channel assesment

RFA1_CCA_THRES_VALUE:

This is the value of the CCA_THRES register that controls the energy levels
used for clear channel assesment.

RFA1_DEF_RFPOWER:

This is the default value of the TX_PWR field of the PHY_TX_PWR register.
This can be cahanged via the PacketTransmitPower interface provided by the
RFA1ActiveMessageC.

RFA1_DEF_CHANNEL:

This is the default value of the CHANNEL field of the PHY_CC_CCA register.
This can be cahanged via the RadioChannel interface provided by the
RFA1ActiveMessageC.

RFA1_RSSI_ENERGY:

If you define this, then the content of the PHY_ED_LEVEL is queried
instead of the RSSI value for eahc incoming message. This value can be
obtained with the PacketRSSI interface.

RFA1_ENABLE_PA:

This enables the DIG0/DIG3 pins needed for controlling an external power
amplifier. If this is enabled, those pins mustn't be used as gpio, the
driver won't check this.

RFA1_PA_BUF_LT and RFA1_PA_LT:
These are controlling the lead time of the external power amplifier, and they
are loaded into the PHY_TX_PWR register. Check the datasheet for more information.

RFA1_ENABLE_EXT_ANT_SW:

This enables the DIG1/DIG2 pins needed for controlling an external antenna
switch (e.g. for antenna diversity). If this is enabled, those pins mustn't be
used as gpio, the driver won't check this. If you enable this, you must set
eighter RFA1_ANT_DIV_EN, RFA1_ANT_SEL0 or RFA1_ANT_SEL1.

RFA1_ANT_DIV_EN:
Enables antenna diversity. RFA1_ENABLE_EXT_ANT_SW must be set before of this,
otherwise it has no effect.

RFA1_ANT_SEL0 and RFA1_ANT_SEL1
Selects antenna 0 and 1 respectively. RFA1_ENABLE_EXT_ANT_SW must be set before
of this, otherwise it has no effect.

RFA1_DATA_RATE

Sets the default data rate of the radio. Can be set to 250 (defualt), 500,
1000, 2000. All values are in kbit/s. However, the SHR and PHR are always
transmitted with 250kbit/s

RFA1_HARDWARE_ACK

If you define this, then the radio stack will use hardware acknowledgements
and address recognition. In particular, you will not be able to snoop on
onther messages (without defining RFA1_HWACK_NO_ADDRESS_RECOGNITION). The
load on the CPU is reduced, you should be able to send more messages under
heavy load.

RFA1_HWACK_64BIT

Enables 64 bit addressing. Basicly, just loads the 64 bit address during init
from LocalIeeeEui64C, it doesn't change the address length of the stack. It is
disabled by default, because some platforms might not provide LocalIeeeEui64.

RFA1_HWACK_FASTACK

By default, the IC waits 12 symbol time (192us) before it sends the ack for a
received message. Defining this shortens the time to 2 symbol time (32us). Testing
showed that it enables higher throughput even with messages without ack request.

RFA1_HWACK_NO_ADDRESS_RECOGNITION

Disables the address recognition of the chip, without this, you will not be able
to snoop on onther messages with RFA1_HARDWARE_ACK. It adds some cpu load, since
every message will be downloaded to the stack. (The radio stack's address
recognition will filter the messages in the receive interfaces)

RFA1_HWACK_NO_ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS

Disables the hardware generated acknowledgements. Since RFA1_HARDWARE_ACK disables
the Software Acknowledgement layer of the stack, there will be no acknowledgements
sent at all. Useful for packet sniffers.

RFA1_BACKOFF_MIN
RFA1_BACKOFF_INIT
RFA1_BACKOFF_CONG

The minimum backoff time, the initial backoff time, and the cognestion backoff
time in microseconds for the random CSMA/CA algorithm. See the RFA1RadioP.nc.
