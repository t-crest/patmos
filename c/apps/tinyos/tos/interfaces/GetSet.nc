/**
 * The GetSet interface is intended for synchronous reading and
 * writing of small values. The type of the value is given as a
 * template argument. Generally, these values are backed by memory or
 * computation. Because no error code is included, both calls must be
 * guaranteed to succeed. This interface should be used when a single
 * logical unit supports both getting and setting.
