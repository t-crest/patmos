This tree includes the TinyOS 2.0 documentation in tinyos-2.x/doc; 
you can also find the documentation online at:
http://www.tinyos.net/tinyos-2.x/doc/

Please note that RPM releases do not include the doc/ or tools/
directories. They do not include the former because of the above URL,
where corrections can be applied quickly. They do not include the
latter because that compiled versions of its code are installed in
the tinyos-tools RPM.

The basic directory structure is as follows:

apps: Sample TinyOS applications.
  tests: Sample TinyOS applications which test a part of the system.

doc: Documentation
  index.html: Index file to all documentation
  txt: Text files (TEPs)
  html: HTML files (TEPs, installation)
    tutorial: Tutorials
  pdf: PDFs of larger documents, such as the TinyOS Programming Manual

support: Non-nesC code for using TinyOS nodes
  make: TinyOS make system
  sdk: Standard developers kit: serial communication, etc.
    c: C SDK (fully supported, but not exhaustively tested yet)
    java: Java SDK (fully supported, heavily tested and used)
